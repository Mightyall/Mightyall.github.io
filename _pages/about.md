I am a second yeat PhD student in the [Electrical and Computer Engineering Department](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ece/) at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/), under the guidance of [Professor Trac D. Tran](https://thanglong.ece.jhu.edu/).

Before joining JHU, I completed my Master's degree in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://minghsiehece.usc.edu/) at the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/), working closely with [Prof. Justin Haldar](https://mr.usc.edu/). Prior to that, I earned my B.S. in [Automation](https://automation.xjtu.edu.cn/) at [Xi'an Jiaotong University](https://www.xjtu.edu.cn/) in China.

To know more about me, here is my [CV](http://Mightyall.github.io/files/Di_An_CV_2024.pdf)
